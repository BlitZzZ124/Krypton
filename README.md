# Krypton Reanimation. 

- What is this?
-# This project revolves around network manipulation and player accessories to intimidate a clientsided rig as a way to bring back pre-rcd exploiting (in a wacky way.)

- Purpose
-# Uses player hats and network ownership manipulation to take advance off the claimed player hats, thus creating a client sided rig to replicate a new character, which allows to run and replicate animation scripts such as Neptunian V or Krystal dance and so on.

- Examples
-# Moving your parts around, converting filtering disabled scripts to make them replicate, debugging some offsets or animations, and so on.
